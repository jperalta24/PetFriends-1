# PetFriends
PetFriends pet search website 

## 

## Hello there, thanks for checking out this repository! Below you will find details of this PetFriends project.

- Our motivation for this was that we wanted to help somebody find a dog they wanted to adopt.

- We made this because our team wanted to provide a useful service by making a pet finder web app, for those who need to find their dream pet!

- This project was an interesting challenge for us, as we haven't used APIs as in-depth before as we have with this project. Therefore, along the way, with our mistakes, we learned a lot about how APIs work, and have gotten a better with JavaScript, HTML, and using Bulma! 

## Usage 
* A. Click link at the top of the page. Upon entering the website, there is a navigation bar among the top of the screen. Click 'Home', 'About', or 'Find a Friend' to get started. 
* B. If you scroll down, you will see a header 'Click the doggo button for a random dog pic'. Click the doggo button to display a random but adorable dog picture.
* C. Below the doggo button is an animal search bar. You will see dog breed and postal code as placeholders. 
* - Search for your preferred dog breed on the top top. 
* - Search for your zip code on the bottom form.
* D. Click on the 'Search' button to start searching for your doggo! 
* E. Below the search box will display 20 listings of dogs in your area, which may or may not include: 
* - A name of the dog
* - A short description of the dog 
* - A link to the dogs profile listing 
* - A location and area code 
* - A picture of the dog 
* F. On the left of the dog searches is your previous search history. (ONLY SAVES DATA, DOES NOT FUNCTION YET! TO BE CONTINUED!) 
* G. Congrats! Hopefully you find your dream doggo! 

## Technologies 
* This web application uses two APIs 
- https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ 
- https://www.petfinder.com/developers/
* The code was written with HTML, CSS (Bulma), and JavaScript.
